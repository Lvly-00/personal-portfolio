#  Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome!
This is my digital portfolio — a space built with React to showcase my projects, skills, and growth as a developer.
It’s designed to be simple, interactive, and true to my style — clean visuals, smooth interactions, and purposeful design.
I hope it inspires you to connect, collaborate, or just explore what I’ve been working on.

##  Purpose

This portfolio exists to show, not just tell, who I am as a developer.
It combines my technical skills, project experience, and design perspective in a clean, interactive format.
The goal is simple — to make my work accessible, visually appealing, and a true reflection of how I build and innovate.
